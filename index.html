      <h1 class="center-align">Lenny's Pizza</br></h1>
      <p>Lennyâ€™s Pizza is a local and family owned restaurant in the heart of London, Ontario.
        We opened our doors back in 1988 and have been recognized as a cornerstone in the London community.</p>
        <p>Our restaurant is known for its interpretation of classic Italian cuisine
        such as our famous panzerotti, outstanding pizzas, excellent service and friendly staff.
        Our menu items are shopped locally from small bakeries and shops in London,
        as well as fresh vegetables from our home garden in the summer time!</p>
        <p>
        Since we are family owned, our small restaurant is primarily take-out and delivery,
        but we do offer a selection of tables if you decide to dine-in!
